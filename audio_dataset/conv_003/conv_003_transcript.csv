14.54,27.71,SCAMMER,scammer,"Mrs. Davies, we've detected some unusual activity on your debit card. There appear to be two pending transactions for a large amount originating from outside the state. Are you familiar with these?",en-US-BrianNeural
28.09,34.36,VICTIM,victim,"No, I haven't made any recent purchases, especially not out of state. That sounds… concerning.",en-US-AriaNeural
34.77,48.27,SCAMMER,scammer,"Exactly, Mrs. Davies. That's why I'm calling. To prevent any further unauthorized charges, we need to verify your identity and secure your account immediately. Could you please confirm the last four digits of your social security number?",en-US-BrianNeural
49.01,52.92,VICTIM,victim,Uh… I’m a little hesitant to give that out over the phone.,en-US-AriaNeural

110.68,119.2,VICTIM,victim,Wait a minute… I haven’t received any text messages. This sounds… fishy. I think I’m going to call the bank directly to confirm this.,en-US-AriaNeural
120.09,131.17,SCAMMER,scammer,"Mrs. Davies, with all due respect, every second counts. While you're on hold, those transactions could go through! This is a time-sensitive matter. Please, just read me the OTP.",en-US-BrianNeural
