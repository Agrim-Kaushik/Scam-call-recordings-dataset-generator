12.49,25.8,SCAMMER,scammer,"Madam, we've detected some suspicious activity on your debit card. Two unauthorized transactions are showing up – one for ten thousand rupees at a Flipkart store, and another for five thousand at some Zomato place. Did you make these transactions?",hi-IN-SwaraNeural

Otherwise, those fifteen thousand rupees will be gone, and potentially more! Jaldi kijiye, Madam, the OTP is only valid for a few minutes.",hi-IN-SwaraNeural
86.27,96.06,VICTIM,victim,No… I… I don't know. I think I’m going to call the bank directly to check on this. Thank you for letting me know about the suspicious activity.,en-IN-NeerjaNeural
